<!-- 
    This file is used to list all the fields for each table that should not appear in the "display" list when 
    configuring the Express Search.
    
    Entries can be added for each table where the name MUST be lowercase and exactly match the table name.
    The "all" table is used to eliminate fields from all the tables. It's ok to list fields that
    are in some of the tables but not all the tables.
    
    NOTE: fields names are checked in a no case-sensitive manner so capitalization doesn't matter, but
    it would be best to use the column name.
