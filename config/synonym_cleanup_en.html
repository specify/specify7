Synonyms in Specify 6&#39s Taxon Tree are stored differently from the way they were in Specify 5.  During conversions of Specify 5 databases to Specify 6, some taxon synonym names in Specify 5 could not be automatically positioned and displayed in the Specify 6 Taxon Tree. This Synonym Cleanup Tool addresses that issue for Specify 5-to-6 database conversions. The tool will have no effect on collection databases created for the first time in Specify 6, or on Specify 6 databases converted from other types of legacy systems. If your collection&#39s data were not converted from Specify 5 to 6, this tool will not change or improve your Specify 6 database.  If that is the case, do not run the tool, press &#39Cancel&#39 below.

For Specify 6 databases which were converted from Specify 5, visit the Specify Project web site (www.specifysoftware.org) and download the help document entitled: &#34Specify 6 Synonym Cleanup Tool&#34. Before running this tool on your database, read how it may change the location of some synonym entries in your Taxon Tree. Choosing the &#34Create Report&#34 button produces an HTML window with a summary of the changes the cleanup tool would make to the database.
