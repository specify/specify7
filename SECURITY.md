## Supported Versions

We support the latest two major point releases by providing timely updates and

provide customer support.

For non-security issues, our [support team](mailto:support@specifysoftware.org)

also have a large online community of users who are willing to share their
experiences and help each other out. You can visit the
[Specify Community Forum](https://discourse.specifysoftware.org/) to ask any
questions you may have about configuration or deployment.
