We also encourage you to reach out to the Specify 7 team with any questions you
may have. You can contact the team at support@specifysoftware.org.

## Mission Statement

The mission of the Specify Collections Consortium is to advance research and
applied uses of the information associated with specimens and samples held in
biological and earth science collections. With engagement and collaboration from
its member institutions, the Consortium does this by engineering innovative,
open-source software, and by offering training and services to members for the
digitization, integration, and curation of collections data. By collaboratively
creating and supporting robust platforms and tools, the Consortium advances the
mobilization and engagement of collections data in broader research and
computing initiatives for the benefit of its members, science, and society.

_Our mission statement serves as a guiding principle for how our organization
should operate. It defines what our organization stands for, what it values, and
what its goals are. By developing in accordance with our mission statement, we
ensure that our efforts are aligned with our core values and purpose. This helps
us stay focused on our goals, and ensures that all of our efforts are working
together to achieve our mission._

## Getting Started

Preferred way to do Specify 7 development is though our development composition.

[Documentation for getting development Docker composition working](https://github.com/specify/specify7/wiki/Docker-Workflow-for-Development)

## Issue Tracking

All feature requests and bugs are tracked on GitHub. Each issue is sorted into a
project. Each project represents a major Specify 7 component.
[A list of all projects](https://github.com/specify/specify7/projects?type=classic)

If you found a bug, feel free to open a GitHub issue. Similarly, if you are
interested in fixing some issue or adding new feature, feel free to do so! If
you want to work on a larger feature, it would be best if you
[get in touch with us](mailto:support@specifysoftware.org) first so that we can
make sure the process is smooth and efficient.

Our entire workflow for reporting bugs, trianging them, prioritizing the fixes,
testing them and releasing the fixes -
https://github.com/specify/specify7/wiki/Issue-Workflow

You don't have to read every part of that document, but some of the sections in
that document would be relevant

Example workflow:

1. Go through GitHub Projects
2. Find a ticket that you are interested in resolving
3. Fix it in a local fork of Specify 7
4. Open a pull request in Specify 7 repository. In the pull request, mention the
   issue you are solving by putting `Fixes #1234` in the description, where
   `1234` is a number of GitHub issue
5. We will review the changes and merge them into next release. You will receive
   credit in the release notes!

### First Steps

It's recomended to start with issues that are labled with
[good first issue](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
as those require less knowledge of the codebase and are as not urgent. These
would prepare you for taking on larger GitHub issues.

## Code Documentation

### Front-End

On the front-end, we are using TypeScript, React and Tailwind CSS.

Front-end root directory is in
[./specifyweb/frontend/js_src](https://github.com/specify/specify7/tree/testability/specifyweb/frontend/js_src)

Each folder and sub-folder has a README.md file that describes the role of that
directory and provides other meta information.

We have a
[video of a full front-end code overview from January 2023 available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11TDHSz54EhQ5eQPNyaogHOODO8_8Q9yg/view).

## Back-End

Back-end uses Python and Django. It also works closely with a MySQL/MariaDB
database both though Django ORM and though SQLAlchemy.

Back-end root directory is
[./specifyweb/](https://github.com/specify/specify7/tree/main/specifyweb)

[We have a video of a full back-end overview from January 2023 available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OW60g99aiPw1Y8uHdCUxZCiVnLbFhObG/view?usp=sharing)

## IDE Setup

No special IDE configuration is required, but some optional plugins would
improve developer experience -
https://github.com/specify/specify7/tree/main/specifyweb/frontend/js_src#js_src

That document includes a short list. For a full list, see
https://github.com/specifysystems/code-principles

In the browser, you can install React Devtools extension to make debugging React
components easier.

## Code-Style

We prefer functional programming paradigm. In our opinion, perfect code\*
consist of small and pure functions that have clear unit tests, and can be
combined together to solve a complex task.

> \*no code is perfect, but you can still strive for it

On a static analysis side, we use strict TypeScript type checking and Prettier
formatting to make code less buggy and more consistent.

Additionally, ESLint goes beyond that to provide close to a thousand of static
analysis checks and quick fixes, all in a name of clear and bug-free code. Our
ESLint configuration is located in
[@maxxxxxdlp/eslint-config-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maxxxxxdlp/eslint-config-react)

## Test Panel

[Specify 7 Test Panel](https://github.com/specify/specify7-test-panel) is used
for testing bug fixes and pre-release versions of Specify 7.

Once up and running, the test panel can be operated by non-technical users.

If set up properly, it automatically rebuilds all active deployments when
someone pushes new changes on GitHub. It also automatically deploys bug fixes
once those are marked as ready for testing.

The test panel is designed for usage by Quality Assurance people, but could also
be used by external users for quick evaluation or developers when they need to
quickly deploy an older version of Specify to compare behavior.

## Support

A great deal of user-facing documentation is available at our
[Discourse forum](https://discourse.specifysoftware.org/). Most of it is
available to users from member institutions only, thus
[consider joining the Specify Software Consortium](https://www.specifysoftware.org/membership-levels/)
if you are interested in becoming a power user of Specify 7.

Besides the README.md files in most folders in this repository, there is also
some developer facing documentation in our
[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/specify/specify7/wiki).

If you are stuck and need help, consider emailing our support at
[support@specifysoftware.org](mailto:support@specifysoftware.org), opening a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/new/choose) or posting
a question on our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.specifysoftware.org/) as
appropriate.

# Installing Specify 7 Locally

These instructions will guide you through setting up a local development environment for Specify 7.

## 1) Install Required Software

You will need the following software installed on your system:

- **IDE:** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended.
- **Database GUI (Optional):** A tool like [DBeaver CE](https://dbeaver.io/download/) makes it easier to inspect the database.
- **Containerization:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (which includes the Docker Compose plugin).
- **Version Control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Database CLI:** A command-line client for MariaDB or MySQL.

**Install the Database CLI (no server needed):**

- **macOS (Homebrew):**
  ```bash
  brew install mysql-client
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
  ```
- **Ubuntu/Debian:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y mariadb-client
  ```
> **Note:** Do NOT install a local MariaDB/MySQL server. The database will run inside a Docker container.

---

## 2) Get the Source Code

Clone the repository to your local machine. This will check out the `main` branch, which is what you should use for contributions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/specify/specify7.git
cd specify7
```

---

## 3) Set Up Python Virtual Environment

While the application runs in Docker, a Python virtual environment is needed for running helper scripts.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv ve

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source ve/bin/activate
# On Windows (PowerShell):
# .\ve\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip3 install wheel
pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4) Download and Prepare the Demo Database

We provide a demo database to get you started quickly.

1.  **Download the demo database:** [sp7demofish.sql.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b-403b6vHJvEQYaYTuDLsQS_m3QL1yCc/view?usp=sharing).
2.  **Unzip** the file to get `sp7demofish.sql`.
3.  **Move** the `sp7demofish.sql` file into the `seed_database/` directory at the root of the project.

---

## 5) Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit the `.env` file with the following values:

```dotenv
# .env
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=specify
DATABASE_NAME=sp7demofish
MASTER_NAME=sp7demofish
MASTER_PASSWORD=specify
```

> **Important:** The `DATABASE_NAME` and `MASTER_NAME` must match the name of the database you are using (`sp7demofish`).

---

## 6) Run Specify 7

With all the configuration in place, you can now start the application using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The first build will take some time as Docker downloads images and builds the containers. Once it's running, you can access the application at:

- **URL:** [http://localhost/specify](http://localhost/specify)
- **Login:**
  - **Username:** `sp7demofish`
  - **Password:** `specify`

Select any collection to begin.

---

## 7) Connect to the Database (Optional)

You can connect to the MariaDB container to inspect the database using a GUI tool or the command line.

**Connection Details:**
- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `3306`
- **Database:** `sp7demofish`
- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** `specify` (matches `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` in your `.env`)

**Using the CLI:**

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -uroot -pspecify
```

---

## 8) Troubleshooting

**Access Denied / Database Not Found**

If Docker fails to initialize the database correctly, it may be due to old volumes or images.

1.  Stop the running containers (`Ctrl+C` in the terminal or use Docker Desktop).
2.  Fully clean your Docker environment:
    ```bash
    docker compose down -v --remove-orphans # Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes
    docker image prune -a # Removes unused images
    ```
3.  Rebuild and start the containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

**Verify Database State in Container**

If problems persist, you can check the database state directly inside the container:

1.  Find the container ID: `docker ps`
2.  Open a shell in the container: `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash`
3.  Connect to MariaDB:
    ```bash
    mysql -uroot -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
    SHOW DATABASES;
    USE sp7demofish;
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```
This will help confirm if the database was created and seeded correctly.
