# Schema Config

Schema config allows to configure the field labels, usage notes, hide/unhide
fields and formatters/aggregators.

Tables used:

- SpLocaleContainer: Refers to each table in Schema Config. Each Specify table has one `SpLocaleContainer` record for each discipline.
- SpLocaleContainerItem: Contains the entries (fields/relations) for tables in Schema Config.
- SpLocaleItemStr: Contains the name and description strings for each `SpLocaleContainerItem`.

Also, the PickList tables:

- PickList: Defines a picklist in the database. Picklists can be one of 3 types:
    - `type=0`: Refers to user-defined picklists. i.e: picklists containing explicitly specified values.
    - `type=1`: Picklists that are related to a table. The values of the picklist are based on a specified formatter. e.g: CollectionObject > CollectionObjectType.
    - `type=2`: Picklists that generates its values from a field in a given table. Essentially works as a user-defined picklist, but with autogenerated values.
- PickListItem: Contains the values for user-defined picklists. Only used for `type 1` picklists.
