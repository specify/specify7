**Specify 7.7.0 Release Notes**
July 15, 2022

_\[System Administrators: This release includes seven new system data tables
exclusively for Specify 7.7. No existing collection data fields or tables in the
current production database schema (v2.9) are updated in this release, and
nothing in this update affects the concurrent operation of Specify 6. A future
update will add and modify science data fields for Specify 6 and 7.]_

**Introduction**

We are pleased to present this Specify 7.7 update. It represents several
months of extraordinary programming effort by SCC software engineers and
testing staff. We have updated, streamlined, standardized, re-styled,
and added components and functions in this update, while significantly
enhancing the software infrastructure of the Specify 7 web client
front-end. We made substantial progress filling in some of the missing
capabilities from Specify 6 while extending and expanding existing
components and UI elements, in addition to introducing new capabilities
beyond the Specify 6 benchmark.

Specify 7.7 takes collections data management to new levels of functionality,
design, and security. We hope you will agree that it is the best Specify
yet.

We heartily acknowledge the assistance of the members of the SCC Board,
Advisory Committees and of the many SCC Specify users who provided
suggestions and feedback for the development of Specify 7.7. We are
buoyed every day by this grand SCC collaboration. To modestly mutate an
adage, “It takes a village to make great software”. Congratulations all!

**Improving the User Experience: New Design and Capabilities**

_The Specify 7 Web Interface_ has been transformed, modernized and styled
with improved visual design, colors, component properties, consistent
dialogs and by adding a number of user settable interface preferences to
make customizations like font choices, font sizes, and color palettes
meet user aesthetics. Underneath the user interface, Specify 7.7’s
software infrastructure has been re-engineered for accessibility,
extensibility, and code maintenance. Compliance with accessibility
standards improves the software interface and enables the use of screen
readers. Here is our [_Specify 7 Accessibility
Statement_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KXoNTUFQ1_MmyaJ_VRNTYXeyJc_lhcVCKiiVOOQ4x2o/edit)
.
Specify’s tree displays have a new look with accessibility enhancements
and usability improvements like sticky column headers that don’t scroll
off the screen, rank information in autofill search box drop down lists
and new action buttons to move, merge, and synonymize taxa. Technical
documentation for the Specify Forms system and customization options is
at:
[_https://github.com/specify/specify7/wiki/Form-System_](https://discourse.specifysoftware.org/t/editing-forms-in-specify/1557)
.

_User Preferences_ are now accessible through the User Tools menu, click
on user name to bring up the User Tools dialog. The Preferences page is
documented here:
[_https://discourse.specifysoftware.org/t/user-preferences-page/538_](https://discourse.specifysoftware.org/t/user-preferences-page/538)
.

_The Query Builder_ has been wholly re-engineered by adding a field
mapper, better filter value validation, embedded pick list support,
sticky column headers and record previews.

_Record Set_ handling has been enhanced with the ability to add and
delete records, and to query on Record Sets to create subsets.

_Linking In and Out of Specify_ has been extended. The Specify
Network now shows local collection objects on the map on the specify
network page and click on them to go back to the specify form. A little
noticed feature allows Collection Objects to be referenced by a URL and
retrieved for a remote user. If you would like to show a remote
researcher data for a collection object, simply send a URL in this
format
\[https://your-server.institution.edu/specify/bycatalog/institution-codon/catalog-number/\]
to provide read-only access to your Specify 7 web page for the object.

_Schema Configurator._ We built a user interface Schema Configuration
tool into Specify 7.7 to view field properties, change field captions,
Insert field/table descriptions, make fields required, and hide fields
from query builder, assign table formatter and aggregators, assign field
formatter and web links and assign field pick list and create new
picklists, among other customization options.

_Localization._ We improved UI localization (language) support in this
release. We would be happy to work with bilingual volunteers who want to
contribute further languages to Specify’s polyglot capacity.

**Improving Security**

_Accounts and Security._ Specify 7.7 includes a long-needed, role-based
access system that allows great flexibility for institutions to identify
Specify user roles to set access permissions on accounts in a way that
reflects collection policies. The new access and security system will be
introduced in a separate document and we will be providing additional
detailed information on it in coming weeks and months. We also
implemented two new mechanisms for external authentication of user
accounts, enabling single sign on for collections that prefer campus
authentication services. Technical documentation is at:
[](https://github.com/specify/specify7/blob/151a2f31ec8b2bca9a10656e9487cc15e0443240/specifyweb/settings/specify_settings.py#L84)[_https://github.com/specify/specify7/blob/151a2f31ec8b2bca9a10656e9487cc15e0443240/specifyweb/settings/specify_settings.py\#L84_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/blob/151a2f31ec8b2bca9a10656e9487cc15e0443240/specifyweb/settings/specify_settings.py#L84)

issues_**](https://github.com/specify/specify7/milestone/21?closed=1)

**Interface Design, Accessibility, New Components**

  model for external reference. The inspector is accessible by
  clicking on “Database Schema” in the user tools menu.
- Tree-viewer has been updated with a refined design, improved search
  capability and important accessibility-related improvements.
- Data forms now have the capability to clone the current record
  including all data, to create a new record, or to create a new blank
  record (“Add”) with no carry forward data (Minnesota
  Dragonfly). [_556_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/556),

  configured in user preferences.
  [_741_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/741)
- Forms now hide data from users who do not have read access
  permission. [_16_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/16)
- A new paginator has been added, replacing the slider for
  form-embedded subforms.
  [_1039_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/1039)
- XML in app resource files and form definitions are validated when
  editing and uploading.
  [_499_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/499)

**Query Builder**

- The redesigned Query Builder now has a "Mapper" for selecting fields
  and specifying filtering conditions. It works similarly to the Field
  Mapper for specifying Specify database fields to map to Dataset
  columns in the WorkBench (Kansas).
  [_1142_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/1142)

  row in a query that does not have an explicit filter value
  specified.

**Security**

- Implemented a comprehensive Role-Based Access System that provides a
  mechanism for defining roles for each collection, with settable
  permissions to grant privileges to all data tables and components by
  role or by additional policies applied to a user account. Privileged
  users known as “Institution Administrators” (IA) and “Collection
  Administrators” (CA) are defined with super powers for user account
  creation and access permission management.
- Implemented support for single sign-on using external authentication
  with SAML2, and for identity providers that have OpenID endpoints.
  For system administrators this means improved database security and
  easier password management. For end users it provides the
  convenience of having fewer passwords to remember.
  [_513_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/513),
  [_353_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/353)

  rare cases where uploads require updates to the contents of a system
  table, e.g. when uploading a new Taxon tree.
  [_1226_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/1226)
- Institution Administrators (IA) can set default user account
  preferences in App Resources.
  [_1337_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/1337)
- User accounts must now be assigned to a Specify Agent record.
  [_406_](https://github.com/specify/specify7/issues/406)
